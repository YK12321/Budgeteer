**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Contributors:** Terry Liu, YK  
**Action:** Merged Terry's updated content with existing professional README.md

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Core Features Section

**Updated:**
- Changed "Intelligent Search" to "Advanced Filtering" to better reflect Terry's emphasis on filters
- Updated feature #1 to mention "filtering options" explicitly
- Updated feature #4 to include "speculate future prices" per Terry's input
- Feature #5 now emphasizes "Filter by specific stores, item categories, or budget range"

**Before:**
```
5. **Intelligent Search**: Fuzzy matching algorithm finds items even with typos or partial names
```

**After:**
```
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by specific stores, item categories, or budget range to refine your search
```

### 2. ✅ How To Run It - Usage Instructions

**Updated to match Terry's step-by-step language:**

**Single Item Search:**
- Changed to Terry's exact phrasing: "Simply enter the item you want to buy in the search feature"
- Added: "display it across our three selected databases: Loblaws, Walmart, and Costco"
- Explicitly mentioned: "Use the filter options to choose specific stores, items, or budget range"

**AI Shopping List:**
- Used Terry's example: "I need snacks for a party under $50"
- Kept professional flow while preserving Terry's conversational tone

**Manual Shopping List:**
- Matched Terry's instruction: "Type the item into the manual search bar"
- Used exact phrase: "Click 'Add Item' to add one item to the shopping list"
- Kept: "Repeat this multiple times to generate your own shopping list"

### 3. ✅ Tech Choices Section

**Frontend:**
- Changed from "HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript" to "HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"
- Added Terry's reasoning: "We chose HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend"
- Kept professional explanation while incorporating Terry's simplicity

**AI Integration:**
- Added Terry's exact phrase: "We used GPT-4o-mini for the AI system running the app because it is cheap and efficient"
- Maintained technical details about hybrid approach

### 4. ✅ Impact Section

**Added Terry's introduction:**
- Leading sentence: "Families that want to shop cheaply can find the cheapest prices for shopping, and they can budget and save money."
- Added: "The app is also useful for families to speculate future prices of items, and to find times where the prices are the cheapest."

**Community Benefits:**
- Updated #3 to emphasize "optimal buying times to purchase items"
- Added #4: "Price Speculation: Users can analyze historical trends to predict when prices will be lowest"

### 5. ✅ Assumptions Section

**Reorganized into three clear categories:**

**User Assumptions:**
- Added Terry's item availability assumption as #1: "We assumed that the user's item can be found in the shops. If they do not, then the app will simply not display anything"

**Shopping Behavior Assumptions (NEW SECTION):**
- Added Terry's single store assumption: "We assumed that it would be cheaper for the user to buy all the items from the same store, than to travel to multiple stores"
- Added Terry's budget constraint: "If the budget is too low, the AI system removes some items to meet the user's price constraints"

**Technical Assumptions:**
- Kept existing professional technical assumptions
