Team Info: This project was created by Terry Liu and YK for the YEC 2025 Programming Competition.

What It Does: Our solution to the problem of inflation is to create an app that takes in an item the user wants to buy and finds the lowest-cost shop to buy it. The user can also enter a list of shopping items manually or by our AI, and the app will find the store that will give the cheapest cost to buy all the items.

How To Run It:
Single Item Search: Simply enter the item you want to buy in our search feature to search for the item that you want to buy. The app will take your item and display it across our three selected databases, which are Loblaws, Walmart, and Costco, and it will display the cheapest store, along with the past data for the item. 
Shopping List Search: If you want to create a shopping list using artificial intelligence, enter in a prompt to generate one. One example of a prompt is "I need snacks for a party under $50," and entering so will give the user a shopping list of items to buy.  Another method is to manually add shopping list items. Enter in items one by one by typing the item into the manual search bar and then clicking "Add Item." Doing so will add one item to the shopping list item. Do this multiple times and generate your own shopping list.

Tech Choices:  For the backend we chose C++ for speed. For the frontend, we chose HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Finally, we used GPT 4.0 mini for the AI system running the app because it is cheap and efficient.

Impact: Families that want to shop cheaply can find the cheapest prices for shopping, and they can budget and save money.

Assumptions:  We assumed that the user’s item can be found in the shops. If they do not, then the app will simply not display anything. Also, if the budget is too low, the AI system removes some items. Finally, we assumed that it would be cheaper for the user to buy all the items from the same store, than to travel to multiple stores.
